                and by selecting a password, the confidentiality of which shall
                be your responsibility. You may not use anyone else’s Rentberry
                account in connection with your use of the Services, or permit
                anyone else to use the Services or to access password-protected
                areas of the Website using your Rentberry account. You agree to
                notify Rentberry immediately of any actual or suspected
                unauthorized use of your Rentberry account, or any other breach
                of security.
              </SubSection>
              <SubSection>
                Certain Services may be subject to fees charged by Rentberry
                (“Fees”), which will be identified at the point of purchase of
                such Services. Additional functionality and services may be
                offered or provided by us from time to time and these will be
                described on the Website. Services requiring Fees which have not
                been previously agreed upon will be notified to you, and your
                agreement to be responsible for any such additional Fees will be
                required, before any such additional Fees will be applied. We
                will charge your credit card for applicable authorized Fees and
                you understand that, once charged, such Fees are non-refundable.
                If Rentberry does not receive payment from the issuer of the
                credit card associated with your Rentberry account, you agree to
                pay all amounts due upon demand directly to Rentberry, and
                Rentberry further reserves the right to either suspend or
                terminate your Rentberry account and your access to the Services
                in such circumstances. PLEASE NOTE THAT RENTBERRY IS NOT A
                RESELLER OF SERVICES OFFERED BY THIRD-PARTY SERVICE PROVIDERS.

                2. Conditions on Using the Website and the Services
              </SubSectionHeader>
              <SubSection>
                The Website and the Services provide only a neutral online venue
                which landlords, landlord representatives, brokers, property
                managers, sub-lessors (collectively, “Listing Parties”) and
                potential renters can use to find and exchange information in
                connection with potential transactions involving real estate
                and, if they choose, to arrange transactions with one another.
                Rentberry does not counsel parties to real estate transactions,
                show properties, or negotiate rental or sales contracts. No
                brokerage relationship or any agency or fiduciary relationship
                is intended to be or shall be deemed to have been created
                between Rentberry and any user of the Website or Services.
                Additionally, real estate transactions are complicated and are
                governed by various laws, practices and customs. Users are
                advised to seek the help of a licensed real estate professional
                and/or a real estate attorney to help in the negotiation and
                completion of any real estate transaction.
              </SubSection>
              <SubSection>
                You acknowledge that if you use the Services as a potential
                renter of a property listed on the Website, including by
                participating in any offer board for, or by submitting an
                electronic rental application in relation to, a property listed
                on the Website, information that you submit through the Website
                (subject to the terms of the PRIVACY POLICY described in Section
                11, below) will be visible to Listing Parties associated with
                such property and used by them in assessing your qualifications
                as a tenant. If you decide to make an offer through the Services
                to rent any property listed on the Website, you are solely
                responsible for determining the rental price that you want to
                offer to a Listing Party for such property. All users should be
                sure they are comfortable with the price they are offering and
                be aware of the following:
              </SubSection>
              <SubSection>
                a. the acceptance of your offer by a Listing Party constitutes a
                binding agreement to enter into a rental agreement with such
                Listing Party and obligates you to pay all associated fees to
                Rentberry and to such Listing Party;
              </SubSection>
              <SubSection>
                b. if participating in an offer board, placing the highest offer
                to a Listing Party for a property that is the subject of an
                offer board on the Website does not guarantee that you will get
                the property; and
              </SubSection>
              <SubSection>
                c. you are solely responsible for determining the reasonableness
                and prudence of any offer you make in light of the property and
                your circumstances.
              </SubSection>
              <SubSection>
                We have no control over the conduct of our users or the truth or
                accuracy of the information that users post on the Website. We
                do not endorse any persons who use or register for our Services,
                whether as renters or Listing Parties. We make no verification
                of information that any user submits to the Website. We make no
                representations about properties advertised on the Website,
                about the Listing Parties responsible for presenting such
                properties, about the accuracy of information provided by such
                Listing Parties, or about the financial capabilities of, or the
                accuracy of information provided by, prospective renters.
              </SubSection>
              <SubSection>
                Although we may offer features through the Services (including
                through third-party service providers we engage) which are
                intended to assist Listing Parties and potential renters to
                assess the appropriateness of, and to negotiate and consummate
                transactions among themselves, Rentberry does not conduct any
                screening, background investigations or credit checks on any
                individual's character, creditworthiness or rental history, nor
                any investigations of the existence or actual state of any
                property listed. All aspects of transactions between users of
                the Website and Services, including the existence, quality,
                safety or legality of the properties advertised, the truth or
                accuracy of listings, the ability of Listing Parties to rent a
                property or the ability of renters to pay for rental properties
                are solely the responsibility of each user and therefore users
                of the Website and the Services should perform all appropriate
                due diligence, including visiting in person any listed property,
                before entering into a rental contract or any other transaction
                with respect to such property. We strongly discourage renters
                from sharing sensitive confidential information directly with
                purported Listing Parties, or wiring funds to such parties,
                based solely on electronic solicitations from such parties.

                The marks RENTBERRY and the Rentberry logo are registered, and

              <SubSection>
                Listing Parties and Others Listing Property: You are entitled to
                list a property for rent ("Property") only if you own the
                Property, or if you are acting as the managing agent or broker
                for the Property, or if you have the right to sub-let a Property
                without violation of the head lease. You may list a Property for
                as long as the Property remains available for rent. You must
                promptly remove the Property listing from the Service if it is
                no longer available for rent. Rentberry may establish limits on
                the maximum time that listings will remain on the Service, and
                Rentberry shall have no liability or responsibility for the
                deletion or failure to store any listing. By listing a Property,
                you represent and warrant to Rentberry that:
              </SubSection>
              <SubSection>
                a. you will provide accurate, current and complete registration

              </SubSection>
              <SubSection>
                b. your use of the Service will comply with all applicable
                federal, state and local laws, regulations and rules, including
                without limitation the Fair Housing Act, the Fair Credit
                Reporting Act and any applicable rent control or rent
                stabilization laws, and will not violate any contract by which
                you are bound or any third party rights;
              </SubSection>
              <SubSection>
                c. any property that you list on the Service complies fully with
                all applicable health, safety and fire laws and codes;
              </SubSection>
              <SubSection>
                d. in the event you use any feature of the Services provided by
                a third party service provider which allows you to access a
                potential renter’s consumer credit data, criminal history or
                eviction history, you hereby certify that you have a legitimate
                business need for such data in connection with assessing the
                suitability of such potential renter as a tenant of a property
                listed through the Services and use of such data from such
                service provider shall be solely for your internal purposes in
                connection with a potential transaction involving such potential
                renter, and that you will not provide any such data to any third
                party; and
              </SubSection>
              <SubSection>
                f. without limitation of the foregoing, your listing will comply
                with the Fair Housing Act and shall not state any discriminatory
                preference based on race, color, national origin, religion, sex,
                familial status or handicap, or based on any other
                characteristic prohibited by state or local law.

                if any, to Listing Parties with respect to Properties only if
                you have the bona fide intention to rent the Property. If your
                offer to a Listing Party through any such offer board is
                successful and your rental application, including any electronic
                rental application submitted through the Services, is approved
                by the Listing Party, you will be obligated to enter into a
                lease with such Listing Party and to pay in full any associated
                deposits to Rentberry and/or to such Listing Party. You
                acknowledge and agree that you are solely responsible for the
                payment of any deposit required and that no negotiation is
                possible concerning the terms of any rental agreement applicable
                to a property once the offer board in connection with such
                property has closed.

              <SubSection>
                a. If the person entering and/or signing this Agreement is doing

                organization, such person hereby represents and warrants that

                of this Agreement will not violate any other agreement to which

                receipt of written notice from you detailing such
                non-conformance or if Rentberry is unable to do so, Rentberry
                will refund a portion of the Fees you paid for the nonconforming

                YOUR REQUIREMENTS, WILL ALWAYS BE AVAILABLE, ACCESSIBLE,

                OTHER EXPLOITATION OF THE SERVICES, WEBSITE OR THE SITE CONTENT;

                f. UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES WILL YOU BE ENTITLED TO RECOVER FROM
                RENTBERRY ANY INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, INDIRECT, PUNITIVE OR
                SPECIAL DAMAGES (INCLUDING DAMAGES FOR LOSS OF BUSINESS, LOSS OF
                PROFITS OR LOSS OF USE), WHETHER BASED ON CONTRACT, TORT
                (INCLUDING NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE ARISING FROM OR RELATING TO
                THE USE OF THE SERVICES, WEBSITE OR SITE CONTENT; HARM OR DAMAGE
                TO YOUR PERSON OR PROPERTY AS A RESULT OF USING THE SERVICES;

                OF THE SERVICES; OR ANY ACTUAL OR ATTEMPTED COMMUNICATION OR
                TRANSACTION BETWEEN USERS, IN EACH CASE, EVEN IF RENTBERRY HAS
                BEEN INFORMED OR SHOULD HAVE KNOWN OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
                DAMAGES. IN THE EVENT THAT THE FOREGOING SENTENCE IS NOT
                ENFORCEABLE, RENTBERRY’S MAXIMUM AGGREGATE LIABILITY TO YOU WITH
                RESPECT TO ANY DAMAGES ARISING IN CONNECTION WITH USE OF THE
                SERVICES, WEBSITE OR SITE CONTENT SHALL BE THE GREATER OF $25 OR
                THE AMOUNT OF ANY FEES RECEIVED BY RENTBERRY FROM YOU DURING THE
                SIX-MONTH PERIOD PRIOR TO THE DATE ON WHICH THE CAUSE OF ACTION
                ACCRUED, WHETHER SUCH DAMAGES ARISE IN CONTRACT, TORT (INCLUDING
                NEGLIGENCE), OR OTHERWISE. THE FOREGOING REMEDIES AND
                LIMITATIONS SHALL APPLY NOTWITHSTANDING THAT ANY REMEDY FAILS
                ITS ESSENTIAL PURPOSE. THE PROVISIONS OF THIS CLAUSE h. WERE AND
                ARE AN EXPRESS PART OF THE BARGAIN BETWEEN YOU AND RENTBERRY AND
                WERE A CONTROLLING FACTOR IN THE SETTING OF ANY FEES PAYABLE TO
                RENTBERRY.

                12. Applicable Law and Jurisdiction; Compliance
              </SubSectionHeader>
              <SubSection>
                The Website and Services are operated by Rentberry from the
                United States, and Rentberry does not represent or warrant that
                use of the Website or Services is lawful in other jurisdictions.
                All matters arising from or relating to this Agreement, the
                Website or to the use and operation of the Services shall be
                governed by the substantive laws of the State of California,
                without regard to its conflicts of laws principles. Without
                derogation of the obligation to arbitrate set forth in Section
                13 below, you and we agree to submit to the personal
                jurisdiction of the state and federal courts located in San
                Francisco, California. The Uniform Computer Information
                Transactions Act shall not apply to this Agreement. If you gain
                access to the Services from locations outside the United States,
                you will be responsible for compliance with all local laws of
                any such other location, and in no event will you use the
                Services or Site Content in violation of U.S. export laws or
                regulations.
              </SubSection>

                13. Arbitration and Dispute Resolution.
              </SubSectionHeader>
              <SubSection>
                All disputes arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the
                Website or the Services shall be resolved exclusively by binding
                arbitration before a single arbitrator (the “Arbitrator”) in
                accordance with the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American
                Arbitration Association (the “AAA”) then in effect (for
                information on the AAA and its rules, see www.adr.org.) and the
                further procedures set forth herein, except that each party
                retains the right to seek injunctive or other equitable relief
                in a court of competent jurisdiction to prevent the actual or
                threatened infringement, misappropriation or violation of a
                party’s copyrights, trademarks, trade secrets, patents or other
                intellectual property rights. The arbitration shall be conducted
                in San Francisco, California, unless the Arbitrator shall
                determine that that venue is not reasonably convenient to all
                parties, in which case the Arbitrator shall determine another
                venue that is. In the event that the AAA is unavailable or
                unwilling to administer the arbitration, and the parties are
                unable to agree to a substitute, a substitute shall be appointed
                by the court. The Arbitrator shall have authority to issue any
                and all remedies authorized by law. The arbitration shall be
                governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. §§ 2 et seq.
                Notwithstanding any rules of the AAA to the contrary, any claims
                shall be adjudicated on an individual basis only, and YOU WAIVE
                ANY RIGHT TO BRING ANY CLAIM AS A REPRESENTATIVE OF A PROPOSED
                CLASS, ON AN AGGREGATED OR MASS BASIS, OR AS A PRIVATE ATTORNEY
                GENERAL, OR TO CONSOLIDATE ARBITRATION PROCEEDINGS WITHOUT THE
                CONSENT OF ALL PARTIES THERETO. Any award rendered by the
                Arbitrator shall be final, conclusive and binding upon the
                parties hereto. In connection with any arbitration proceeding
                pursuant to this Agreement, unless the Arbitrator shall
                determine otherwise, each party shall bear its own costs and
                expenses. Notwithstanding the foregoing, you may at your option
                file an individual claim in any small claims court for disputes
                or claims within the scope of its subject matter jurisdiction if
                such court has personal jurisdiction. Rentberry does not hereby
                waive any defense that such jurisdiction may be lacking in your
                state. Without derogation of the parties’ obligation to
                arbitrate as set forth herein, for any claims other than those
                in small claims court, jurisdiction for any court proceedings
                arising out of or relating to this Agreement, the Website or the
                Services shall be vested exclusively in, and venue shall be laid
                in, the state or federal courts sitting San Francisco,
                California except that, following confirmation of an arbitration
                award in a state or federal court in San Francisco, California,
                a judgment arising therefrom may be executed in any court of
                competent jurisdiction.

                will impair any such right or be construed to be a waiver
                thereof, and a waiver by Rentberry of any of the covenants,
                conditions or agreements to be performed by you will not be
                construed to be a waiver of any succeeding breach thereof or of
                any other covenant, condition or agreement hereof contained. As
                used in this Agreement, "including" means "including but not

                then this Agreement will remain in full force and effect and
                will be reformed to be valid and enforceable while reflecting
                the intent of the parties to the greatest extent permitted by
                law. Except as otherwise expressly provided herein, this
                Agreement sets forth the entire agreement between you and
                Rentberry regarding its subject matter, and supersedes all prior
                promises, agreements or representations, whether written or
                oral, regarding such subject matter. You shall not assign or
                transfer this Agreement or any right or obligation hereunder to
                any third party. You agree that the electronic text of this
                Agreement constitutes a writing and your assent to the terms and
                conditions hereof constitutes a "signing" for all purposes.
